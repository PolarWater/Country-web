                        <h2>More about Latvia</h2>
                    <p>The sheer volume of wild nature makes Latvia one of the greenest countries in the world. Ironically one may say that half of Latvia is not covered by lush forests. The country holds one of the rarest ecosystems of the world largely untouched by civilization. It is a haven for the visitor who seeks to experience a land where nature and tradition have coexisted in harmony from time immemorial.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Diverse environment</h2>
                    <p>The pristine nature of Latvia is rich and diverse. An odd hillock decorates the rolling Latvian plains in between the sea, the lakes and countless rivers. Stately forests, broad mires, meadows, groves and gardens form the unique mosaic of the Latvian landscape. Pastoral serenity is what the Latvian countryside stands for.</p>
                    
                    <div class="img-02"></div>
                    
                    <p>If you like nature, you will love Latvia. Latvia resembles a nature preserve at times interrupted by spots of highly urbanised landscape of European modernity. This is an exceptional land where woodlands, marshes, lakes and rivers have developed over the centuries at their own pace with minimal human interference.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Forests</h2>
                        
                    <p>Latvian forests are a mix of northern coniferous and southern deciduous trees. One may discover a patch of pines next to a birch tree forest and a diverse spectrum of other species throughout. Nearly a quarter of local forests grow on wetlands because of the unique climate and terrain. Wetland forests ensure high biological diversity. Many plant and animal species survive only in constant habitats provided by the Latvian nature.</p>
                    
                        <div class="img-01"></div>
                        
                        <p>Several of Latvia's forests meet the criteria for a natural forest. They also afford a rich supply of berries, wild strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and loganberries. The berry-picking season lasts from late June until late September. It is also the time for gathering mushrooms. The most popular mushrooms are the edible boletus, orange cap boletus, chanterelles and rusulla. Apart from clearly marked private lands, the wealth of Latvia's forests, berries, mushrooms and hazelnuts is accessible to anyone.</p>

                    <ul>
                            <li>Nowhere else in Europe will you find such a large population of the black stork and the lesser-spotted eagle. 65 thousand square kilometres of Latvia hold hundreds of wolves and lynxes, 4 thousand otters and 100 thousand beavers. Latvian seaside is almost unspoiled by resorts, restaurants or hordes of holidaymakers all over the 500 km white sand beach.  </li>
                            <li>With over 800 Art Nouveau buildings, Riga has one of the world’s greatest galleries of this joyful style. Alberta iela is a street almost entirely created by Art Nouveau genius Mikhail Eisenstein, and his son film director Sergei Eisenstein was one of the founders of modern cinema.</li>
                            <li>With over 1 million folk songs, Latvians love to sing. You can catch over 10,000 of them on stage at once at the Song Festivals, and opera stars like Inese Galante, Elīna Garanča, Aleksandrs Antoņenko and Egils Siliņš delight audiences at home and abroad.</li>
